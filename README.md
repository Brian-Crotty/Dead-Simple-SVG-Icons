## About the Project

I needed a couple svg icons for a project and I wasn't happy with the ones I found online. So I made my own. They are really quite small as svgs. I used SVGO (in the SVGOMG web app) and then hand edited down what little non essential content remained. Please take and use them wherever you want. It's unlicense so feel free to copy and paste the code! If there's an icon you really want, make an issue and I'll throw it together. Besides that, icons are added as I need them, enjoy!

### Built With

- [Affinity designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/)
- SVGO
- SVGOMG

## Usage

The svg files are edited to within an inch of their lives, its the absolute minimum that will display correctly. To use, either add the svg file to your directory and add an image tag with the path to the file OR add the svg code into an html file as is. Either way you go, make sure to add width and height attributes as desired. The icons (besides the logo) are square (24px by 24px).

## Acknowledgments

[SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) by [@fcaylus](https://github.com/fcaylus) makes some extremely tiny svg, it's very impressive. I started using it with the web gui [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) by [jakearchibald](https://github.com/jakearchibald) which offers the same functionality but with a visual gui to configure. Highly recommended.
